Encapsulation ChallengeCreate a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques. 
The class will be called Printer and it will simulate a real Computer Printer. It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed, and also whether itâ€™s a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed.
